INSTALL
	perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install;
	Do 'make install' as root if installing into root-protected directories
TEST ISSUES
	Prompt for database parameters doesn't appear on some machines when using 'make test'	
		Running test scripts individually will solve this.
	Tests skipped by Test::Harness but not skipped when run individually.

Description
	This Class::DBI library displays several database queries in an outline format.
